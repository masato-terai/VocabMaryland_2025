```{r, include=FALSE}
rm(list = ls()) 
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(rstan)
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
```

## Embodied (Grounded) Cognition 

- Humans understand not only the lexical meaning of a word but also evoke their accumulated experiences (e.g., seeing, touching) associated with the word (e.g., **Barsalou, 2008**).

## Activation of Color Information
### Connell and Lynott (2009)

- Activation of Objects' color
- Semantic Stroop task
  1. Read a sentence (e.g., *Joe was excited to see a bear in the woods.*)
  2. The keyword is presented in color ( <font color="brown">**bear**</font> )
  3. Answer the color of the font
- [Demo video](https://youtu.be/WFRbEMdWlXY)

## Connell and Lynott (2009)
### What they found
- When the indicated color and the font color matched, the reaction times were faster than mismatched.

- Sentence (*Joe was excited to see a bear in the woods*): üêª
- Matched: word ( <font color="brown">**bear**</font> ): **Faster**
- Mismatched: word ( <font color="green">**bear**</font> ): **Slower**

## Processing in Second Language
### Difference between learning and acquisition

- Context of English Learning in Japan
  - **English:** primarily learned in classrooms as a foreign language.
  - **Japanese:** naturally acquired

- Activation of objects' shape is **reduced** in second language (e.g., Chen et al., 2020; Norman & Peleg, 2022, 2023)

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("material/acquisition_learning.png")
```

## Terai (2023)
- Replicated Connell and Lynott (2009) in both first and second language

- Interaction of second language proficiency and typicality (Second language)

  <div style="border: #83cafc dashed 2px; font-size: 100%; padding: 15px;">Second language proficiency was operationalized using the vocabulary size scores.</div>
    

## Processing in Second Language
### Terai (2024)
- Word-level processing

  - üêª: Joe was excited to see a bear [in the woods / at the North Pole] (Terai, 2023)
  
- Context doesn't affect that much?

## Processing in Second Language
### Terai (2024)
- No notable Stroop effect

  - Language was between subject design

## Influence of Task Types

- Huettig et al. (2020)

![](material/huettig_2020.png){width=100% height=100%}

## Influence of Task Types

- Huettig et al. (2020)

  - Color information was activated **when a task supported the involvement**

## The Study
### Research Questions and Hypotheses
<div style="border: #83cafc solid 2px; font-size: 100%; padding: 15px;">
- Does the magnitude of reaction time differences between conditions (i.e., the Stroop effect) differ between the sentence-level and word-level experiments?

    - PredictionÔºöSentence-level task shows larger Stroop effect
</div>

- Does this pattern differ between the native language and the foreign language?

    - PredictionÔºöL1 task will elicit larger Stroop effect regardless of word- or sentence-level.
  
## Analysis

- Dependent Variable:
RT (reaction time) of the Stroop task from Terai (2023) and Terai (2024)

  - Terai (2023): Sentence-level
  
  - Terai (2024): Word-level

- Independent Variables:

  - Task type (with/without sentence presentation)

  - Typicality of font color (typical / atypical / unrelated)

  - Interaction (task type √ó typicality of font color)

  - Font color (red / white / green / brown)

- Random Effects:

  - Word: task type, typicality of font color, interaction, font color

  - Participant: typicality of font color, font color

## Results
- A notable interaction effect was observed.

- A main effect of task type was also confirmed.

## Post-hoc Analysis
- Estimated Marginal Means
  
  - The Stroop effect was confirmed only in the sentence-level experiment.

- Bars: Median, 75%, and 95% intervals

![](material/emmeans_plot.png){width=70% height=70%}

## Post-hoc Analysis
- pd: *Probability of Direction*:

  - The proportion of posterior samples that fall in the same direction (positive/negative) as the median.

## Discussion
### R.Q. 1
- The degree of color simulation is influenced by the type of task.

  - Tasks that provide context in advance promote greater simulation.

  - Color simulation does not always (routinely) occur.

### R.Q. 2
- Task language did not have a notable main effect and interaction of other variables.

  - The task effects are consistent regardless of the L1 or L2.

## Limitations and Future Directions
- Task type was not treated as a within-subject factor.
