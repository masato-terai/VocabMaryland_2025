```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Embodied (Grounded) Cognition 

- Humans not only understand the lexical meaning of a word but also activate their accumulated sensory and motor experiences (e.g., seeing, touching) associated with that word (e.g., **Barsalou, 2008**).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}

## Activation of Color Information
### Connell and Lynott (2009)

- Activation of Object color information

- Semantic Stroop task
  1. Read a sentence (e.g., *Joe was excited to see a bear in the woods.*)
  2. A keyword is presented in color ( <font color="brown">**bear**</font> )
  3. Answer the color of the font
- [Demo video](https://youtu.be/WFRbEMdWlXY)

## Connell and Lynott (2009)
- Reaction times were faster when the indicated color matched the font color, compared to when they mismatched.

- Sentence (*Joe was excited to see a bear in the woods*): üêª
- Matched: word ( <font color="brown">**bear**</font> ): **Faster**
- Mismatched: word ( <font color="green">**bear**</font> ): **Slower**

## Difference Between Learning and Acquisition

- Context of English Learning in Japan
  - **English** is primarily learned in classrooms as a foreign language.
  - **Japanese** is naturally acquired

- Activation of objects shape is **reduced** in second language processing (e.g., Chen et al., 2020; Norman & Peleg, 2022, 2023)

## Terai (2023)
- Replicated Connell and Lynott (2009) in both the first and second language

- Interaction of second language proficiency and typicality (in the second language)

  <div style="border: #83cafc dashed 2px; font-size: 100%; padding: 15px;">Second language proficiency was operationalized using vocabulary size scores.</div>

## Processing in Second Language
### Terai (2024)
- Word-level processing

::: {layout-ncol=2}

:::

## Results
- No notable Stroop effect

  - Language was between subject design

## Influence of Task Types

- Huettig et al. (2020)

![](material/huettig_2020.png){width=100% height=100%}

## Influence of Task Types

- Huettig et al. (2020)

  - Color information was activated **when a task supported the involvement**

## The Study
### Research Questions and Hypotheses
<div style="border: #83cafc solid 2px; font-size: 100%; padding: 15px;">
- Does the magnitude of reaction time differences between conditions (i.e., the Stroop effect) differ between the sentence-level and word-level task?

    - PredictionÔºöSentence-level task shows larger Stroop effect
</div>

- Does this pattern differ between the native language and the foreign language?

    - PredictionÔºöL1 task will elicit larger Stroop effect regardless of word- or sentence-level.
  
## Analysis

- Dependent Variable:
RT (reaction time) of the Stroop task from Terai (2023) and Terai (2024)

  - Terai (2023): Sentence-level
  
  - Terai (2024): Word-level

- Independent Variables:

  - Task type (with/without sentence presentation)

  - Typicality of font color (typical / atypical / unrelated)

  - Interaction (task type √ó typicality of font color)

  - Font color (red / white / green / brown)

- Random Effects:

  - Word: task type, typicality of font color, interaction, font color

  - Participant: typicality of font color, font color

## Results
- A notable evidence for an interaction effect (**Task \* Typicality**), and main effect of **Task Type**.

## Post-hoc Analysis
- Estimated Marginal Means
  
  - There was evidence for a Stroop effect only in the sentence-level task.

![](material/emmeans_plot.png){width=70% height=70%}

- Bars: Median, 75%, and 95% intervals

## Post-hoc Analysis
- pd: *Probability of Direction*:

  - The proportion of posterior samples that fall in the same direction (positive/negative) as the median.

## Discussion
### R.Q. 1
- The extent of color simulation is influenced by task type.

  - Tasks that provide prior contextual information promote greater simulation.

  - Color simulation does not always (routinely) occur.

### R.Q. 2
- Task language showed no notable main effects or interactions with other variables.

  - The effects of task type were consistent across both L1 and L2.

## Limitations and Future Directions
- Task type was not treated as a within-subject factor.

  - The distribution of L2 proficiency varied across conditions.
